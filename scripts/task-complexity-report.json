      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into: repository creation, React 19 + TypeScript initialization, library installations (Jotai, tailwind v4, radix-ui/primitives), project structure setup, configuration of ESLint/Prettier/TypeScript, and verification of build and dependency setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple setup steps, each with its own configuration nuances. Integrating React 19 with TypeScript, setting up code quality tools, and ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed requires careful sequencing and validation[1][2][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Define Sim Data Model and Types",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: drafting the Sim interface, implementing field-level validation/types, and writing unit tests for the type definitions.",
      "reasoning": "Defining TypeScript interfaces is straightforward but requires attention to detail for validation and test coverage. The scope is limited to type definitions and basic tests[1][4]."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Local Storage Data Access Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: implementing save function, load function, update function, serialization/deserialization logic, and enforcing max sim count with tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires robust handling of local storage, data integrity, and edge cases like serialization and enforcing limits, making it moderately complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Sim List View Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: designing the component layout, implementing data rendering, adding responsiveness, and testing with mock data.",
      "reasoning": "Building a list view is a common React task but requires attention to layout, responsiveness, and performance, especially for mobile compatibility[1]."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Create New Sim Form",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: form UI implementation, input validation logic, metadata handling, UUID generation, and data persistence to local storage.",
      "reasoning": "Form creation with validation and dynamic metadata fields adds complexity, especially with character limits and data persistence requirements."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Sim Display Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: displaying sim details, editable log textarea with auto-persist, metadata table rendering, and timestamp display.",
      "reasoning": "Displaying and editing data with auto-persistence involves state management and UI updates, but the requirements are well-scoped."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Sim List Navigation and Selection",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break into: implementing navigation logic, integrating with React Router, and testing sim selection and detail view transitions.",
      "reasoning": "SPA navigation is standard in React but requires careful state and route management to ensure correct sim selection and view updates."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive UI and Layout",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: applying Tailwind CSS breakpoints, testing each component on various screen sizes, optimizing layout for mobile, and usability verification.",
      "reasoning": "Ensuring full responsiveness across all components and devices requires iterative testing and layout adjustments, especially with Tailwind CSS."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Data Persistence and Session Handling",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: verifying data save/load, handling corrupted data, managing storage limits, implementing error handling, and testing persistence across sessions.",
      "reasoning": "Robust data persistence and session handling involve edge case management and error recovery, increasing complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Success Criteria and Performance Testing",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: defining measurable success criteria, setting up performance tests for sim creation and list loading, testing data persistence, verifying responsiveness, running tests on desktop/mobile, and documenting results.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive validation across performance, usability, and reliability, involving both manual and automated testing and cross-device verification."
