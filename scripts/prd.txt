# Sim System - Core MVP PRD

## Overview
The Sim System is a minimal character simulation viewer and creator. Users can create simple text-based entities ("sims") with flexible metadata and view them in a clean list interface. This PRD focuses strictly on the essential viewing and creation functionality that can be built incrementally.

## Problem Statement
Users need a simple way to:
- View a list of their created sims
- Create new sims with log content and metadata  
- See basic details about each sim at a glance

## Core Features (MVP Only)

### 1. Sim List View
**What it does:** Shows all sims in a simple scrollable list
**How it works:**
- Display sim log preview and creation date
- Show whether sim has log content or is empty
- Clean, readable layout
- Handle up to 100 sims initially

### 2. Create New Sim
**What it does:** Form to add a new sim
**How it works:**
- Simple form with optional initial log content (0-10,000 chars)
- Optional metadata as key-value pairs (key: 0-100 chars, value: 0-10,000 chars)
- Simple validation (character limits)
- Save to local storage
- Use UUID4 for unique sim and metadata IDs

### 3. Basic Sim Display
**What it does:** Show individual sim details
**How it works:**
- Display log contents in textarea, editable, edits auto persist to local storage
- Display metadata in simple key-value pair table
- Allow adding, editing, and removing metadata
- Show creation/update timestamps

## Data Structure
```
Sim {
  id: string (UUID4)
  log: string (0-10,000 chars)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

Metadata {
  id: string (UUID4)
  entity_id: string (foreign key to Sim.id)
  key: string (0-100 chars)
  value: string (0-10,000 chars)
}
```

## Technical Requirements
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Local Storage for data persistence
- Jotai for state management
- Tailwind v4
- Radix-UI/primitives
- Zod for data validation
- Responsive web interface
- Works in modern browsers

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see all my sims in one place
2. As a user, I want to create a new sim with log content
3. As a user, I want to add flexible metadata to my sims
4. As a user, I want to read and edit sim details clearly
5. As a user, I want my sims to persist between sessions

## Success Criteria
- User can create a sim in under 30 seconds
- Sim list loads in under 1 second
- Interface works on desktop and mobile
- Data persists reliably in local storage
- Metadata system is intuitive and flexible

## Constraints
- Maximum 100 sims for MVP
- Text-only content (no images/media)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- Log content limited to 10,000 characters
- Metadata keys limited to 100 characters
- Metadata values limited to 10,000 characters

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Search/filtering  
- Icons/images
- AI features
- Import/export
- Performance optimization for large lists
- Rich text formatting
