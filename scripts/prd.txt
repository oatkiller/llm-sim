# Sim System - Core MVP PRD

## Overview
The Sim System is a minimal character simulation viewer and creator. Users can create simple text-based entities ("sims") with basic metadata and view them in a clean list interface. This PRD focuses strictly on the essential viewing and creation functionality that can be built incrementally.

## Problem Statement
Users need a simple way to:
- View a list of their created sims
- Create new sims with basic information  
- See basic details about each sim at a glance

## Core Features (MVP Only)

### 1. Sim List View
**What it does:** Shows all sims in a simple scrollable list
**How it works:**
- Display sim name, description, and creation date
- Show whether sim has content or is empty
- Clean, readable layout
- Handle up to 100 sims initially

### 2. Create New Sim
**What it does:** Form to add a new sim
**How it works:**
- Basic form with name and description fields
- Optional initial log/content text
- Simple validation (required name, character limits)
- Save to local storage

### 3. Basic Sim Display
**What it does:** Show individual sim details
**How it works:**
- Display sim name, description, and content
- Show creation/update timestamps
- Read-only view initially

## Data Structure
```
Sim {
  id: string (UUID)
  name: string (required, max 100 chars)
  description: string (optional, max 500 chars)  
  content: string (optional, max 5000 chars)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Local Storage for data persistence
- Responsive web interface
- Works in modern browsers

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see all my sims in one place
2. As a user, I want to create a new sim with basic info
3. As a user, I want to read sim details clearly
4. As a user, I want my sims to persist between sessions

## Success Criteria
- User can create a sim in under 30 seconds
- Sim list loads in under 1 second
- Interface works on desktop and mobile
- Data persists reliably in local storage

## Constraints
- Maximum 100 sims for MVP
- Text-only content (no images/media)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- Read-only sim viewing (no editing after creation)

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Sim editing/updating
- Advanced metadata
- Search/filtering  
- Icons/images
- AI features
- Import/export
- Performance optimization for large lists
- Rich text formatting

See [Comprehensive Design Document](../design_docs/comprehensive_design.md) for full technical details and future features.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Project setup with React + TypeScript
- Basic sim data structure
- Local storage utilities
- Simple routing setup

### Phase 2: Core Display  
- Sim list component
- Individual sim view
- Basic navigation between views
- Responsive layout

### Phase 3: Creation Flow
- Create sim form
- Form validation
- Save to storage
- Success/error handling

### Phase 4: Polish
- Improved styling
- Loading states  
- Error boundaries
- Basic accessibility

This MVP focuses on proving the core concept works before adding complexity.
