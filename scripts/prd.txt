# Sim System - Core MVP PRD

## Overview
The Sim System is a minimal character simulation viewer and creator. Users can create simple text-based entities ("sims") with basic metadata and view them in a clean list interface. This PRD focuses strictly on the essential viewing and creation functionality that can be built incrementally.

## Problem Statement
Users need a simple way to:
- View a list of their created sims
- Create new sims with basic information  
- See basic details about each sim at a glance

## Core Features (MVP Only)

### 1. Sim List View
**What it does:** Shows all sims in a simple scrollable list
**How it works:**
- Display sim name, description, and creation date
- Show whether sim has content or is empty
- Clean, readable layout
- Handle up to 100 sims initially

### 2. Create New Sim
**What it does:** Form to add a new sim
**How it works:**
- Basic form with name and description fields
- Optional initial log. max 10,000 chars.
- Optional metadata. these are key value pairs. can have up to 100. key name max 100 chars. value max 1000 chars.
- Simple validation (character limits)
- Save to local storage
- use a uuid4 to define a unique id string for each sim when its created.

### 3. Basic Sim Display
**What it does:** Show individual sim details
**How it works:**
- Display log contents in textarea. editable. edits auto persist to local storage.
- Display metadata in simple key-value pair table. 
- Show creation/update timestamps
- Read-only view initially

## Data Structure
```
Sim {
  id: string (UUID)
  name: string (required, max 100 chars)
  description: string (optional, max 500 chars)  
  content: string (optional, max 5000 chars)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## Technical Requirements
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Local Storage for data persistence
- Jotai
- tailwind v4
- radix-ui/primitives
- Responsive web interface
- Works in modern browsers

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see all my sims in one place
2. As a user, I want to create a new sim with basic info
3. As a user, I want to read sim details clearly
4. As a user, I want my sims to persist between sessions

## Success Criteria
- User can create a sim in under 30 seconds
- Sim list loads in under 1 second
- Interface works on desktop and mobile
- Data persists reliably in local storage

## Constraints
- Maximum 100 sims for MVP
- Text-only content (no images/media)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Advanced metadata
- Search/filtering  
- Icons/images
- AI features
- Import/export
- Performance optimization for large lists
- Rich text formatting
